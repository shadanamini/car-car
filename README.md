## Sales microservice

Explain your models and integration with the inventory
microservice, here.

I began building my microservice by creating several models. There were models for the sales person of the dealership (properties include employee name and number), the potential customer (properties include customer name, address and phone number), and a sales model (properties include foreign key relationships to other models as well as an individual sales price). I then created the views to generate the components in Insomnia. These were for individual or list of customers, individual or list of sales persons, and individual or list of sales. After completing the views, I then configured the URLs and began working on the front end portion of the sales microservice. Several forms were created and used to generate new sales person, new customer, as well as a new sale and list of sales.
